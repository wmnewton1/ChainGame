Chain Game

Concept: Players take turns placing counters/beads on a grid. Each bead must be adjacent to a bead of the same colour. Players win by dividing the opponent's beads such that two unconnected groups of beads exist.
		 Each player can replace one bead from the other player with their own. However, the other player cannot immediately undo this on their following turn.
